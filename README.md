# ðŸ“· A Little Photo Blog  

The site is completely written in **Svelte**. I used this little project to start learning **Svelte/SvelteKit** and web development more generally.  
At some point, I decided to use **GitHub Pages** to host the siteâ€”though I ran into quite a few limitations when trying to make picture fetching work.  

## ðŸŽ¯ The Purpose  

The blog is actually going to be used by a photographer. Since she has no coding skills, asking her to use GitHub felt unnecessary.  
To solve this, I wrote a **GitHub Action** that periodically fetches pictures from a **Google Drive folder**.  

## ðŸ’¡ Reflections  

Overall, this has been a fun little experiment, as it was my first time making a site of any kindâ€”let alone one that someone actually intends to use!  

If you have any feedback, feel free to reach out. I'm hoping to continue learning and take on more complex projects in the future.
